```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
##Chi squares

```{r}
#chi sq between the proportion of offers in 2010 vs 2020


```



## Poisson regression

```{r }
data <- read_csv("final_mod_zcta.csv") %>% 
  mutate(all_years_avg_offers = round(all_years_avg_offers, digits = 0), 
         all_years_wt_avg_offers = round(all_years_avg_offers, digits = 0),
         wt_avg_2020 = round(wt_avg_2020, digits = 0))


model1 <- glm(all_years_wt_avg_offers ~ modzcta_cum_perc_pos, family = poisson, data = data)
summary(model1)

broom::tidy(model1)

#this is the main model
model2 <- glm(wt_avg_2020 ~ modzcta_cum_perc_pos, family = poisson, data = data)
summary(model2)

broom::tidy(model2)

#how to calculate either a 1% or a 10%
(-.005702126 * 10)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
