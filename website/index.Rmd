## Data Sources
* **SHSAT Admissions Test Offers by Sending School (2015-2021)** Specialized 
high school admission test offers by district borough number was obtained
from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=SHSAT&sortBy=relevance).

* **NYC COVID-19 Positive Tests by Zip-Code** Weekly zip-code level SARS-CoV2 
testing data was compiled for New York State beginning March 1, 2020 by the
[New York State Department of Health](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing-by-Zip-C/e7te-hhb2).

* **NYC COVID-19 Death Rates by Zip-Code** Monthly zip-code tabulation area 
(ZCTA)-level SARS-CoV2 death ratedata was obtained from 
the [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data).

* **Crosswalk File for Zip-code to ZCTA**  We used a [crosswalk file](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/Geography-resources/ZCTA-to-MODZCTA.csv) to convert zip-codes to ZCTAs to obtain consistent area units across the datasets.
